"""
Check cross-document count consistency for the template's public surfaces.

Prevents the drift pattern that hit PRs #70, #76, #78 — where adding a skill
(agent, rule, hook) updates `.claude/` but leaves stale counts in README,
CLAUDE.md, the guide source, the rendered guide, or the landing page.

Run via `./scripts/check-surface-sync.sh` pre-commit, or `/commit` will
invoke it automatically.

Exit codes:
    0 — all counts consistent
    1 — drift detected (prints a diff)
    2 — internal error (missing surface file, unreadable directory)
