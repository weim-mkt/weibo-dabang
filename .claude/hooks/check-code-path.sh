# Drift guard for the scripts/R/ -> code/ migration (this fork's convention).
#
# This fork has migrated all R-script paths from scripts/R/ to code/. When
# upstream merges land, they may reintroduce scripts/R/ references. This
# script greps for any remaining live references (excluding archival files
# that legitimately mention historical paths) and reports them so the user
# can fix the drift before it propagates.
#
# Wired in two places:
#   1. .claude/settings.json -> SessionStart hook (Claude-side coverage)
#   2. .githooks/post-merge   (terminal-side coverage; needs core.hooksPath)
#
# Exits 0 unconditionally so it never blocks a session start. Drift is
# reported via stdout/stderr to surface the warning without halting work.
